I have developed many skills through Senior PA and Management roles which have both challenged and equipped me in becoming a confident, resilient character, with the ability to take the lead in any number of situations. I have built on my management and key administrative skills, whilst putting into practice my major strengths around organisation and time management. These skills have enabled me to work in fast paced environments whilst maintaining the ability to multi-task. I am comfortable supporting a team as well as working on a one-to-one basis, and bring a dedicated, hard-working and enthusiastic personality that would complement the image of any professional company.
