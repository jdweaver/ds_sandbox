 I have worked in the food & drink, consulting, retail and customer service sector for a number of years, learning successfully how to deal with customers plus learning key sales techniques to provide the best service for both my workplace and the customer/client.

My interests include sports (rugby, football, golf and going to the gym), cooking, reading and socialising with friends. I also like to travel, and undertook a gap year in 2008/2009 where I travelled around the world to places such as South-East Asia, Oceania and North America.
