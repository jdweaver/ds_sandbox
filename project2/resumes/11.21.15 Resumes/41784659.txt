I am computer technique. Work nine hours a day and have one hour for lunch and 15 minutes in the morning and afternoon for lunch ... I think long enough, only the lunch hour should be higher.
Like what I do and I'm proud of it.
Earning the minimum wage and I think for the study that I may be little, but you can not give up, nor give the pleasure of losing the job.
