September 2009 - Ongoing
Mystery Shopping/Merchandising/Auditing

Mystery Shopping
* Entering a location and playing out a scenario provided by the company employed to assess and test a location and their staff. This is normally the general level of customer service provided (politeness/friendliness of staff), assessing the location for cleanliness, layout, correct promotional displays etc. All aspects of the job are set out in the brief and details of what is to be asked, looked for and ordered (if applicable) must be complied with.
* There is a high level of staff interaction in terms of testing their knowledge and willingness to help, as well as speed of service. The role also includes the ability to narrate and complete a report on the job completed and a high level of detail and observation is required, as well as the ability to think quickly to complete the required scenario without being identified as a Mystery Shopper.
* Within this there is also an element of assessing staff to make sure rules and regulations are being complied with, mainly focused on financial service's e.g. correct documentation is checked or staff members level of information regarding topics covered by the FSA.
* Brand analysis jobs have been completed, where a third party (e.g. Sony wants a visit to a Comet outlet) send the shopper to assess the shops displays/merchandising and staff knowledge on a brand that they stock in store.
My work within this role is varied and some of the establishments visited are retail outlets, restaurants, telephone calls, banks, supermarkets and other customer based service environments.

Auditing
This work is divided into open (they are aware of what you're doing) and covert (to be done unnoticed).
Open audits are more detailed and comprehensive and require a sample stock take on items within the store, investigating and reporting any missing items. I have also completed some work to make sure planograms are correctly adhered to.
Covert audits are smaller in detail (as one cannot carry around a long list) and are mainly to check store compliance. This usually takes shape by checking they are selling certain items and can be located in the correct place, promotional material is present and displayed appropriately, product displays are secure and age restricted items are not missold.

Merchandising
I have completed a number of projects where I have visited an outlet to provide and display promotional material, in accordance with the company instructions and correctly display the items I'm there to organise.

I have also done various other work such as assessments of the usability of websites, automated telephone systems, focus groups and other smaller projects with an emphasis on customer service

During this work I have also learned how to keep detailed accounts and transactions in order to complete my end of year self assessment.


My previous employment before 2008 is mainly part time and temporary due to being in full-time education. I took on work where possible to fit around my studies, hence the number of roles and time spent in each position.
