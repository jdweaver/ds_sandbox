Attn: hiring manager, 
I am very interested in the recently advertised position of artist production assistant (Job # REDACTED) and I wish to apply. I have obtained my Bachelors of Arts from REDACTED  and I have several years of print making experience. This includes fine copper plate engraving, having been employed at the REDACTED  print making studio. During this time I developed techniques for engraving under a microscope and later taught these skills in a college course as a TA. I have also casted metal and plastic sculpture for other projects. Because of my experience and ability, I am able to work very delicately on high-stakes projects. In addition to that, I think my punctuality, attention to detail and creativity will also prove to be a large asset to the company.
My resume, which is enclosed, contains additional information on my experience and skills. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the specifics of the position with you and to provide further information on my candidacy.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this exciting opportunity. 
Sincerely, 

REDACTED
