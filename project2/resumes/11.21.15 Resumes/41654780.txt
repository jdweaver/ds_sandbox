Front  Desk Associate, Night Auditor, Bistro Server/Bartender

Hired in as a Front Desk associate and  Night Auditor. I was responsible for maintaining the highest quality of customer care  and  satisfaction for business clientele. As a auditor I ran a hotel alone at night handling key paperwork and addressing security issues if they arose. I transitioned over to the in-house restaurant for a greater challenge in the evening where  I cooked  and  tended bar in a challenging environment. While in this capacity I've been responsible for saving the company thousands of dollars by finding unique solutions to problems.



Interests 	

I love computers and  learning new subjects. I spend a lot of time researching new topics each week  to expand my knowledge. In my free time I also take lessons in Japanese in a effort to better  communicate with one  of my closest friends and  understand different thought  processes. Sports and  exercise are  also hobbies of mine. On a daily basis I push myself to the limit to see what i'm capable of.
