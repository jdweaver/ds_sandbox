Education

Bath University, BEng(Hons) Aerospace Engineering with Placement Oct 2011 - June 2015
Acheived First-class honours

My ﬁnal year project was self-initiated and involved using a genetic algorithm in combination with
a rudimentary form of CFD called Vortex Lattice Method to optimise an aid delivery UAV for
maximum range whilst weighing below 7kg. As this was a mutlidisciplinary problem it required me
to be thorough and investigate all the necessary assumptions and constraints necessary so that my
limited time was allocated eﬃciently to deliver the best results possible.

Employment
record

Abellio Greater Anglia, Norwich, Norfolk, UK
October 2015 - Present
I am currently in a temporary role involved with compensation for customers who have been delayed;
issuing vouchers or cheques where appropriate. Emphasis is placed on speed and accuracy in order
to process as many forms as possible.

Airbus Defence & Space, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK
August 2013 - July 2014
I was mostly involved in creating and modifying programs to help with automating and optimising
existing tasks within the stress oﬃce on site. I also had to become familiar with the preparation and
publication of documents relating to the work I had performed e.g. manuals for the programs I had
written. I was most proud of creating an auxiliary tool for automating the ’stress mapping’ process
of satellites. Previously this would manually take an Engineer up to a month to perform hence this
tool will save the company thousands every time it is used.

SEP Events, Costessey, Norfolk, UK
June 2011 - June 2011
I worked as a Car Parking Marshal at the Royal Norfolk Show. I ensured that cars were directed
to the appropriate places and to prevent drivers from parking in unsuitable places. This required
me to be constantly communicating with members of my team and with people entering the event.
Due to the large number of visitors car parks could quickly ﬁll up meaning that it was necessary to
quickly react to the situation under the pressure of irate drivers until I could get to my line manager
to alleviate the situation.

The Advertiser, Costessey, Norfolk, UK
November 2006 - September 2011
As a Newspaper Deliverer I ensured that roughly 160 houses in my area received their newspaper by
noon. Leaﬂets had to be placed manually inside the papers and the newspaper carrier was often not
big enough for the papers to be delivered in one trip. This required me to develop time management
and organisation skills to complete the job eﬃciently.

Computing skills I am competent with the use of standard Microsoft Oﬃce applications. I’m proﬁcient in the use
of LATEX and MATLAB for report writing and numerical analysis. From my industrial placement I
became familiar with a variety of programming languages such as VB10, VB6, QBasic and Fortran
which I used to create and modify complex programs for automation and optimisation.

In my spare time I have been learning about Python as part of a hobby using the Raspberry
Pi. I am also familiar with using html to create websites from scratch.
