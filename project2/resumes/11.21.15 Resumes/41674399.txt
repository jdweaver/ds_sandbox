Research Experience
Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University





Master's student
*	Project: Analyzed HIV samples from an international clinical trial for associations with antiretroviral resistance and treatment failure.
*    Job duties: Sequenced and analyzed over 500 HIV samples for HIV resistance. Determined HIV
genetic diversity in 6 regions for over 100 samples using high resolution melting analysis.

Rotating graduate student
*	Project: Explored activated peritoneal macrophage gene expression in mice with induced inflammatory bowel disease.
*    Job duties: Sacrificed 50 mice and collected macrophage through peritoneal lavage.
Characterized macrophage through flow cytometry and ELISAs.

Rotating graduate student
*    Project: Grew and characterized gene expression of knockout strains of tuberculosis (TB).
*	Job duties: Cultured and analyzed 4 strains of TB in 6 different stressed growing conditions in a bio-safety level 3 facility. Explored a putative TB gene's expression with northern blots.


Department of Microbiology, Brigham Young University



International iGEM team member

*	Project: Synthetically created and characterized new RNA thermosensors for use in biological logic gates.
*	Job duties: Randomly mutated a known thermosensor from L. monocytogenes and cloned new thermosensors into E. coli. Characterized and submitted 10 new thermosensors to the iGEM parts database.
*    Achievements: Awarded Gold Medal at the regional jamboree. Presented work at the world
jamboree at MIT in Boston.





Research assistant
*    Project: Optimized a DNA filtration technique and tested a novel antibiotic.

*    Job duties: Determined optimum temperature and buffer conditions for filtering DNA in spore-
forming bacteria. Performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing of a novel drug on MRSA.

Undergraduate HHMI Phage Hunters Program
*    Project: Isolated and characterized novel mycobacteriophage from the environment.
*	Job duties: Discovered bacteriophage through plaque identification in bacterial and viral culture. Characterized the virus morphology through electron microscopy.  Prepared DNA for sequencing and then annotated its genome.




BD Diagnostics

Work Experience




Intern
Jan-Apr 2011
*    Project: Assisted in testing of new BactecTM Bottle configurations.
*	Job duties: Prepared antibiotics and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures. Inoculated bottles with blood, bacteria and antibiotics for BactecTM bottle testing. Analyzed BactecTM media through cyclic voltammetry for future improvements.


BYU Independent Study



Tutor
*	Responsibilities: Tutored students in science from middle school to first year college classes in physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy and geology. Helped test, improve and correct course content and design.
