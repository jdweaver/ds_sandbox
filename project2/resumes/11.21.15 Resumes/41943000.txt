I have around fourteen years of business research experience. As a startup member of the Irevna, a pioneer among KPOs in India, I had the unique experience of working on research assignments of leading Investment Banks and Management Consultancies in the world. Assignments at two different service lines (Consulting & FAS) of Deloitte gave me exposure to strategic research, company and intangible asset valuation skills. At UBS, I was involved in M&A research and modeling assignments in the beginning and later moved to investment/thematic research highlighting various industries and companies to invest in. Currently, I am involved in leading a team of strategy researchers providing research and strategy support to Cognizant BPS top management. My work has covered every major sector with specific focus on Consumer and Retail, Financial services and TMT and involved companies in all parts of the world.

This rich and varied research experience has provided me the skill sets to analyze organisations from different perspectives. Apart from the usual financial and operational analysis, I am equally comfortable at assessing business cycles, technology disruptions intangible assets, market potential and macro environment.
