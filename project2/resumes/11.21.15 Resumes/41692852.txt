As a fresh thinking Stage Management graduate, I wish to transfer the project management, organisation and creative skills learned in a theatrical context and transfer them to develop a career within events management in the charity sector. I am a confident and driven individual who is proactive in learning and furthering my skills. My bubbly nature and friendly yet professional approach allows me to form and sustain relationships with others on any level and throughout my experience I have been able to flourish in fast paced, dynamic environments. My positive outlook and enthusiasm for life has given me the ability me to adapt to new situations quickly. It is these qualities that will make me an invaluable member to any team.
