Personal
I believe that I would be very well suited to working in a busy and varied environment and even though I lack experience I believe my enthusiasm and friendly disposition would allow me to settle in anywhere quickly. Previous involvement in drama groups has given me a good level of confidence and the ability to communicate well with others. I also believe that this experience has helped me better relate to people and become more approachable. During school I gained work experience in a year 3 classroom and this has shown me that I am able to adapt to new situations well and has given me confidence in my ability to think on my feet and keep my head in stressful situations. In my spare time my hobbies include crocheting, reading and baking.
