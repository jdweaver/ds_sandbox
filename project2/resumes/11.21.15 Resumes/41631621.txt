
About MeI owned and operated my own affiliate marketing and content creation business for 14 years during which time I have created multiple websites along with their text and graphic content. Through these, I have marketed the products and services of numerous companies ranging from large Fortune 500 corporations to small mom and pop businesses via various affiliate and advertising relationships. 

For the past 18 months I have been employed at Arvato Digital Services as a Transaction Specialist supporting Microsoft's OEM operations. 

Through both these roles I have learned to be supremely detail oriented, customer focused and adaptable. I have developed excellent written communication skills over the course of many years of email communication between myself, affiliate managers and customers around the world. These skills have been honed through my more recent role at Arvato. 

I have excellent computer and Internet skills with a proficiency in Microsoft Office products. I learn new skills quickly and thoroughly and am adept at anything technical in nature.
