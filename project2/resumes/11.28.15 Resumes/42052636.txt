Interests

I am an avid computer user; I can pick up how to use a program within a few minutes of first interacting with it, and am able to get to grips with advanced features very rapidly.
I volunteer for and help moderate several online self-help forums which focus on helping users overcome their problems through support, motivation and interaction with people in similar situations.
