I preferred the Oklahoma Climatological Survey's page on Vertical Structure of the Atmosphere. This site focused on the layers and relative scale of Earth's surface and atmosphere.  The website was written like a textbook and also gave more information and explanation for the earth's atmosphere.  I believe that this was the best webpage of the three provided because it provided me with facts that could be crossed referenced in our books as well as other websites that I looked at.  Our text states that the Average thickness of the Troposphere : 12 km (7.5 mi)16 km (10 mi) thick at Equator 8 km (5 mi) thick at poles.  This webpage illustrates from the earth's surface to 11-12 km above, temperature decreases with height.  The webpage shows that the stratosphere is marked by a temperature inversion from about 11-12 km to 50 km above sea level this also corresponds with.   Our text explains the same exact thing.  Both as well state the same information about the Mesosphere and Thermosphere.  I loved the illustrations as well as they were different than our text.  There was not much that I did not like about the site except its layout.
