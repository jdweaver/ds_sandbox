Resumes
  Resumes  often  serve  as  your  initial  contact  with  employers  and  are  the  most  critical  item  in  determining 
whether or not you will obtain an interview. It is a brief “advertisement” of your skills, knowledge, and relevant 
experience. If you are seeking positions across industries, you may need to have several versions of your resume 
specific to each type of job you are seeking.
 
Ideally your resume should emphasize your strong points while expressing your uniqueness and individuality. 
Therefore, you should present yourself clearly, succinctly, and confidently. Use the suggestions here to develop your 
resume and consult the samples provided to gather ideas
  Do not copy these examples verbatim!

an interview.

read  statements  focusing  on

GPA:
•  If  your  cumulative  GPA  is  a  3.0  or  
  above, it is beneficial to list it. 
• Be sure that your GPA matches what  
  an employer would find on your official  
  University  transcript. That  means  no  
 
•  If your cumulative GPA is below a 3.0,  
  consider listing both your Major GPA  
  and your cumulative GPA, or you may  
  prefer to list your Major GPA alone.  
 
It is recommended that you visit with 
  your academic advisor to discuss the  
  best method for calculating this GPA  
 
if  it  is  not  listed  on  your  degree  
  audit.
•  If  you  work  a  substantial  amount  of  
  hours per week to pay college expenses  
  while attending college full-time, you  
  may include a statement highlighting  
 
this  within  your  Education  section.  
  This  kind  of  statement  can  serve  as  
 
justification  for  a  GPA  that  may  not  
  be an accurate representation of your

As  a  first-year  student  or  sophomore, 
it  is  appropriate  to  include  information 
from your high school years on a resume. 
However,  as  you  continue 
to  grow 
professionally  and  gain  experiences  that 
demonstrate  increasing  relevance  to  a 
particular career field, you may begin to 
omit  items  that  are  outdated  or  that  no 
longer  effectively  highlight  your  current 
abilities. Typically, it is recommended that 
information  from  high  school  years  be 
omitted  from  your  professional  resume 
by the time you begin your junior year at 
Penn State.

Resume Formats
Chronological Format
Present education and work experience in reverse chronological order, describing responsibilities and achievements 
under each entry. This is the most appropriate format if you have experience directly related to your career goal.
 
Functional Format
Your experience is explained under major skill headings, while job titles, employers, and dates are listed sepa-
rately. This type of resume is especially useful when your degree or work experi ences are not directly related to 
your career objective.
 
Combination Format
In many instances, the combination of both the chronological and the func tional formats may be the most effective. 
This is especially the case when some past experiences are more directly related to future goals than others. 
This format allows for experiences to be separated into different categories—related and unrelated—making the 
strongest impact by placing the most related experiences first, regardless of the dates during which the experiences 
took place.
