Skills
	I feel my best skills are my can do attitude and never leaving a job unfinished.  I am easy to get on with and very friendly and always smiling and willing to help both fellow colleagues and customers.  I always have a positive attitude towards my work and like to ge stuck into a new task as soon as possible.  I enjoy working as part of a team or on my own where I can use my own initiative. Other than the jobs listed above I have also worked as a volunteer in a busy Solicitors and Newspaper office as an administrative assistant from leaving school in 2004 to 2007.  During my spare time I enjoy travelling as and when I can and playing tennis.  My biggest achievement to date is spending 3 weeks in America with a group of 12 strangers going from LA to New York.  
During my time at Oxfam I lead a small online team selling both donated stock and stock I had sourced from Oxfams “Book Barn” and corporate donations from Ted Baker.  The initial target for the financial year for online sales was £12,000 by April of 2012 we had made over £21,000 from online alone.
