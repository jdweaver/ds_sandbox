I have always had an enthusiasm and interest in IT. I am sociable and always 
willing to give work my best attempt. Good communication is also a quality 
I possess, acquired from experience in coordinating and leading a team. I 
can also work on my own initiative whilst still working hard and efÔ¨Åciently.

EXPERIENCE 
2007 - 2014 
Co-operative Food Store, Oswestry 
I have worked for The Co-operative for 7 years as a Customer Team Member 
and as a Team Leader. 

As a Customer Team Member, duties include stock replenishment, customer 
service and offering helpful service. 

The Team Leader's role is more supervisory. It includes, taking 
responsibility for training and managing staff so we offer the best service we 
can. It also involves administrative roles such as stock control, banking cash 
and making sure prices and paperwork are accurate. 

Due to store restructuring where I was working, there was a possibility that 
my working week would be shaved back to the 23 hours in my contract. In 
order to continue to work a 40 hour week, I preferred to return to a 
Customer Team Member role at a large store in Oswestry. 

2004 - 2007 
JD Wetherspoons in Oswestry, Shropshire 
I worked for 3 Years in the The Wilfred Owen, JD Wetherspoons in 
Oswestry. 

I worked in the kitchen and was responsible for preparing and cooking 
meals, keeping the kitchen clean and tidy and general duties to ensure the 
kitchen ran smoothly.
