Dear Dr Koh,
Thank you for taking the time to review my resume. I am interested in applying for a teaching position, Learning Support Officer at ST Joseph's Institution. Being an Alumni (class of 2007), I feel drawn back to the school to teach the new batch of Josephians. I have teaching experience from Secondary to Junior College level. 
I have had the opportunities to tutor my cousins and friends at both Secondary Level and Junior College level whilst serving my National Service. Hence I am still in touch with the current syllabus and content. At the present time I am tutoring two Secondary four students to prepare them for O level. This position enables me to provide them with the tips and tricks for their exams. I have also been providing tuition for Secondary and Junior College student since 2010.
In my junior year at the National Junior College, I taught at the Nanyang Primary School under the Class Adoption Program to help the weaker pupils to improve on their Mathematics and Sciences. This allowed me to learn how to communicate with younger students and to be able put forth my ideas clearly and properly.
Having spent four wonderful years at ST Joseph's Institution, I would love to be given the opportunity to teach the student and interact with them. Having gone through the same curriculum, it would be easier for me to share with them my experiences and to counsel them if they encounter any difficulty. It is my goal to combine my range of experiences with my ability to be a compassionate, enthusiastic and intelligent teacher who will make a positive contribution to the new generation of SJI students. This would also allow me to contribute purposefully before I embark on my medical degree in the United Kingdom.
Sincerely, 
Quek Kai Wei Sean
