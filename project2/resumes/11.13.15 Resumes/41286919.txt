RESEARCH

Research Interests
My research examines the institutional environments in which multinational enterprises (MNEs) operate. These institutional dynamics are highly relevant for international business because by definition MNEs operate in multiple countries with potentially widely varying or contradictory formal (e.g. regulatory) and informal (e.g. cultural) institutional expectations. Obtaining and maintaining legitimacy within these diverse markets creates special challenges for MNEs.  

Using this institutional lens as a unifying theme, I examine how firm outcomes are shaped by the institutional characteristics of their operating environments. In particular I am interested in how firm corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility are impacted by formal and informal institutions, including corruption. 

My research conceptualizes the MNE as a portfolio of locations and applies a unique portfolio operationalization technique that converts country-level data to the firm level, holistically accounting for the formal and informal institutional impacts of all of a MNE's headquarters and subsidiary location environments.
