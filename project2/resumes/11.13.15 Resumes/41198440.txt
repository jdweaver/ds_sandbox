	
I am a hard-working employee with excellent organisational and customer service skills who likes to give 110% to every task I am involved in. I enjoy using the skills I have to achieve these tasks as well as taking the time to learn new skills that will help me to develop both in and out of the workplace.
Achievements 
* In July I was awarded a Mary Gober award for most improved member of staff for the quarter. This was awarded for showing great initiative and willingness to expand my role. While my main role is to log and acknowledge complaints, I have been trying to resolve as many complaints in one go as possible, resulting in the early closure of over 70 cases. Meaning that customers got a prompt response to their concerns and lessening the work load of the rest of my team.
* In my role as Document Controller I am proud to have been nominated for a Capita People Award - I was praised for my job skills, being a very supportive member of the team who was always the first to help others, going the extra mile to make sure work is finished before deadline and always being happy to take on new work or volunteer to assist with projects when opportunities arose.
* I was promoted to the role of Installation co-ordinator while at ADT Fire & Security.
* In 2010 I completed a 375 mile cycle ride across the French Battlefields to raise funds for Help For Heroes. I personally raised £3,000 which helped raise a combined total of a staggering £1,000,000. In 2012 I once again put on my fundraising hat to raise £1,000 by participating in a tandem skydive with the Red Devils Display Team.
