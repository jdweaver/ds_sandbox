Interests

I have always taken an active role in the workplace, whether on the more formal side of things such as networking and volunteering for events, but I also think it is important to be involved socially, where appropriate, too.

When I have the free time outside of work I try and visit the gym regularly and play golf badly. I am currently developing my interest in Spanish, building on the Foundation Course I attended at the Brasshouse Centre and I also enjoy live music, either playing or listening. Football, good cinema, nice wine and modern fiction round up my main interests.
