I currently write high quality web content that includes SEO. 
I have experience in all types of writing including fiction, non-fiction, sales ad and copy writing, eBooks, technical articles, and ghost writing. 

My experience working for the two major search engines has given me a unique opportunity to incorporate these skills along with my writing talents to produce high quality content that ranks high. 

Besides my SEO and content experience, I possess a Bachelor of Arts in English, and a Master of Arts in English Literature.

My Employment Story

Newstrax    November 2000? 2007

I headed the local branch of this organization. This was a company which recorded news and community type local programs. Next spider software was used to ferret out news stories or segments which featured companies or individuals. We would then attempt to sell clips from the jobs to the people who were either featured, or who had an interest in the segment. 

Most of our clients were corporations or small businesses. However, we also sold to individuals who wanted to chronicle an athletic or social achievement.

This was a great opportunity for me, and I really loved working with the company. However, technology soon got the better of us, and the company was forced to close.

This is a grassroots organization that uses voters to push forward the agendas of clients to elected members of Congress. We would use a dialer to call registered voters based on data we received from boards of elections. We would apprise these people of upcoming votes in Congress, and would try as best as we could, to put across the opinion of our client. 

People really do want to give their opinions, but many feel inadequate when it comes to communicating with members of Congress. We offered them the choice of either writing their elected official themselves, or we would write their letter, send it to them for approval, and return the completed letter bearing their signature to them, along with stamped envelopes addressed to their member(s) of Congress. 

Within a year, I was promoted and running my own campaigns. In addition to running campaigns, I also got the opportunity to meet with and interact with members of Congress, their staff, small businesses, and in some cases, defense contractors. This was a great job, but continuing to push forward political actions and agendas I didn't necessarily agree with took its toll. I had spent years working with really great people, and I think I did some good. However, by 2011, it was time to move on.

Lionbridge Technologies

September 2011?December 2014

I worked as a website evaluator for Google search engine. My job was to review sites, check for spam, and verify their search engine placement. These evaluations were done to apply current quality standards to make sure search engine pages were ranked properly and inferior websites weren't included in returned search results

These were contract positions as opposed to a regular job. However, I learned a great deal about search engines, and search engine optimization. My time spent working with the company has greatly improved my ability to provide good, sound web content that can rank high on search engines.
 
After my contracts with the company ended in 2014, I became a freelancer specializing in SEO-rich web content.
