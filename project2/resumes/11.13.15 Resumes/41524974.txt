PERSONAL STATEMENTDuring and after university the majority of my experience was coaching based, but after living and working in schools I realised teaching is my true passion and so getting qualified was imperative. I have learnt an incredible amount during my PGCE and I continue to develop my knowledge and understanding of outstanding teaching. I consider myself to be a caring, hardworking and a trustworthy individual with good inter personal skills and a fun loving nature. EXPERIENCETEACHING PRACTICE PLACEMENTS LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERISTY
