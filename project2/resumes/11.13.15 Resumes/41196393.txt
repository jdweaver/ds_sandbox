Work Experience
Summer 2010 - Hammersmith and Fulham City Council
I undertook two days work experience at Hammersmith and Fulham City Council's Planning Enforcement Department. I accompanied Enforcement Officers on site visits, where I learnt about the Council's building policies and how they are enforced.
Summer 2011 - Total UK Ltd
I worked for two months as a Level 1 Retail System Analyst, providing technical support for Total's Petrol Stations across the UK. On a day to day basis, I had to deal with calls from sites suffering IT issues, and had to attempt to identify the problem and fix it, or take the necessary steps to escalate it. It gave me a great insight into working in an office environment, and dealing with people over the phone to isolate the issues they were having.
Summer 2012 - Titan Environmental Surveys Ltd
I undertook work experience with Titan Environmental Surveys. I was onboard a survey vessel conducting a survey in the Bristol Channel monitoring the aggregate resource for a dredging company.  The vessel was collecting swathe bathymetry, side scan sonar and collecting sub-bottom data, and then comparing that to data collected last year.  In addition to this, they will also be conducting land survey profiles on the beaches so that they overlap with the vessel based work. This experience enabled me to witness first-hand how a survey company operates, by observing both the data being collected, and then being analysed in an office.
September 2014-present - Transport for London
I am currently on a graduate scheme, training as a traffic control engineer at Transport for London. We are responsible for managing the road network in London, which includes over 600 traffic signals.
