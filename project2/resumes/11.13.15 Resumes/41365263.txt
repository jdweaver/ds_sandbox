APPRENTICESHIP

During  my  GCSE  studies  I  was  chosen  together  with  five  other  students  to  participate  in  an  Automotive 
Mechanic Apprenticeship at Paragon ITE. During the two year course undertook practical skills such as light 
vehicle maintenance and repair together with the ability to work from diagrams and written instructions. The 
apprenticeship gave me hands on experience in engineering which supplements the theoretical aspects of my 
degree studies.
At the end of my apprenticeship, Paragon ITE entered me into the “South West Apprentice of the year Award” 
which I subsequently won.

IT EXPERIENCE
Good working knowledge of several word processing packages including Microsoft software, CAD and MRP 
systems.
