SPECIAL PROJECTS

* Frito Lay purchased a Marketing/Business Plan I developed for a new whole grain snack endeavor. They are producing savory, whole grain snacks in the near future, and wanted to know how to market these products to consumers: I illustrated the products benefits, evaluated similar product launches, identified target markets and market differentiations, classified promotional outlet opportunities and appropriate marketing channels, and developed the tagline/catch phrase for the product. 
* I developed, pitched, and sold a new name and brand/tagline for TopCo Insurance's venture into the online insurance marketplace. 
* Completed a series of audio transcriptions of various interviews for Sonotype. 
* I wrote web content and product descriptions for Bright Vessel, manufacturers of Himalayan Salt Rock products. 
* I partnered with Sullivan University's Creative Communications department while working in Admissions and developed all of the automated Student Information System email templates.  I also assisted that team with the development and completion of the new programmatic slicks that are used in all email templates.
*  I created a video series for the entire Sullivan University System (Stan Stanley's Series to Success for Sullivan Students) that has been moderately successful in its infant stages on various social media outlets.  
* I mentored two Online Admissions Officers (Sullivan University), so I do have some minimal leadership experience.
