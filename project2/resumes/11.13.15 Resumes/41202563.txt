Interests and Skills

From the age four to eighteen I attended dance classes every week which allowed me to further onto my dance exams where I earned medals, certificates and awards based on the quality of my dancing. I have learnt modern sequence, ballroom and disco. 

I like listening to music and reading. I enjoy making my own jewellery and cards as gifts. I have recently taken up knitting.

During my time in Art College for my final project I designed and made my own dress which I dyed and embellished with various techniques in preparation for the Fashion Show.  

I believe that I am a determined and honest person. I am driven by determination to exceed and set myself high standards in my career.
