MicroelectronicsProfessional Profile 
   I am interested in the design of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits such as amplifiers, comparators, bandgap references, low voltage regulators, data converters, analog and digital filters, both at transistor and system level and in every feature concerning signal processing, device modeling, noise and nonlinearities linked with these types of circuits.

 Thesis Title: "Design Optimization of MOS Devices Based on a More Accurate Description of Their Nonlinearities" - a project based on Europractice IC technology

  - The main topics of the thesis are:
* The impact of different biasing regions on the nonlinear behaviour of MOS capacitances in the MOS transistor model, evidenced as small-signal distortion
* The switching of the MOS device: nonlinear behaviour studied as a cause-effect mechanism
* Large signal distortion due to the swing between strong inversion and weak inversion or between strong inversion and velocity saturation

- The main goals achieved in research and presented in the thesis are:
* Differential amplifier compensation for small amount of distortion - techniques for a rail to rail swing
* Case studies for the propagation of the various distortion sources for an optimized/non-optimized design in CMOS operational amplifiers, latched comparators and switched capacitor filters
* Proven effects of nonlinearities based on total harmonic distortion (THD), periodic AC (PAC) and periodic steady-state (PSS) analyses for the above mentioned types of CMOS circuits

Thesis Title: "Noise in Relaxation Oscillators: Jitter Dependency on Slew-Rate"
 - The aim of the study was:
* to calculate the equivalent input referred noise, considering the noise of the comparator and the noise of the external network;
* to find a mathematical model of jitter;
* to demonstrate the jitter's dependency on non-idealities: dependency on the slew rate of the comparator;
* to define an equation for jitter due to the white noise of the circuit and the slew rate of the comparator;
* to characterise the phase noise of the comparator-based hysteretic oscillator in the frequency domain and
* to calculate the equivalent periodic noise.

 I designed a low pass filter at transistor level using the concept of simulated resistance and I studied the effects of charge injection and applied offset optimization techniques.

- Synchronization using a Colpitts oscillator
The project was designed at system level in MATLAB/Simulink, being based on the nonlinear equation that defines the Colpitts oscillator. Two possible applications were verified: synchronization, using an oscillator as a transmitter and another one as receiver, and the modulation/demodulation process, where one of the state variables was altered by an external signal and then transmitted to a receiver that had to recover it.

I designed a folded cascode operational amplifier, starting from given specifications for gain, bandwidth, slew-rate and noise referred at the input. Also, layout, LVS and parasitic extraction were the final part of the project..
