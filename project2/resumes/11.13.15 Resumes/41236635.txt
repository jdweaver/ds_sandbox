PERSONAL PROFILE:

Having recently worked for over six months for one of the UKs leading online retailers as a Warehouse Operative I have continued to demonstrate excellent work related skills. I worked through an agency on a six month contract and in that time I continually achieved personal and team Key Performance Indicator (KPI) targets. I was a crucial team member and supported colleagues constantly. I demonstrated outstanding practical skills when loading and unloading stock in a physically demanding role. I always rolled up my sleeves and got involved in all areas of work to get the job done quickly and effectively. I took on individual responsibilities and was left to carry out tasks independently and without supervision.
I have strong academic skills and have successfully completed creative media courses up to level 2 since leaving school. I have a personal interest in computer software and editing and have a working knowledge of all Microsoft packages as well as bespoke editing software. I pick up new skills quickly and easily and I am very committed to always learning new skills.
