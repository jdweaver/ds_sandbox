COMPUTING SKILLS
I am experienced with the following languages:

C# / .NETWorked with C# almost every day for the last 6 years on personal and university projects, so this is what I'm most experienced with. I find it relatively easy to pickup new frameworks and APIs written for use in C#. Currently learning the ins and outs of ASP.NET in my spare time.
HTML/XML/CSSUsed frequently in the last 7 - 8 years for various personal projects and pages, as well as the website for two of my released mobile games.
Java Dabbled in Java before starting work on my first mobile game in 2012 - very similar to C# and easy to pickup if I was required to use it in the future
PHP / MySQLGained a good amount of experience with both PHP and MySQL after making my own web-based back-end system for displaying news, scoreboards and change-logs in my mobile games
C++Very basic knowledge of C++ syntax. Used for various university projects (basic ones), and a OpenAL plug-in I made for DarkBASIC back in 2006.
DarkBASICA programming language centred on game development via DirectX 9.0c. Very easy to learn. The first programming language I used.
Lua ScriptingUsed for several modifications for a game called Garry's Mod.

SOFTWARE & TECHNOLOGIES
Game DevelopmentCreated two of my own mobile games and released them on the Windows Phone store, with several updates to both over time.
TCP/IP / InternetCreated client/server programs for a chat system as a personal project. Tested with a couple of friends.
Forum/Community ModeratorVolunteer forum moderator for gaming community JokerIce.co.uk before I started university.
Sever administratorVolunteer administrator for gaming community JokerIce.co.uk. Involved updating gaming severs with the latest modifications via a remote desktop connection (VNC), banning players who broke the rules and handling appeals against bans.
Microsoft WindowsVery experienced user of all versions of Windows since 95. Beta tested Vista, 7 and 8/8.1.
Adobe PhotoshopExperienced user of Photoshop.
Microsoft Visual StudioExperienced user of Visual Studio 2008 - 2015.
Visual Studio Source ControlA source control system integrated into Visual Studio. Experienced User.
Microsoft OfficeExperienced user of Office 95 - 2013. Mainly Word and Excel.
Subversion Network (SVN)Managed a game modification(s) via an SVN repository.
DirectX 11 APIWorking on my own game engine in C# using a DX11 wrapper called SharpDX.
KEYSKILLS:
TeamworkI was the main programmer for the development of a game as my 3rd year university project as part of a team of 5.
Planning and OrganisingI like to stay on top of things, even if it not my area of expertise. I don't like being messed around and like to know when and what needs to be done.
Analytical Thinking & Problem SolvingI love solving problems, big or small (prefer bigger ones). I have an eye for detail and tend to consider the bigger picture for smaller things which sometimes get overlooked. 
Personal EffectivenessAlways a positive thinker, even in the worst of situations. Set up habits for health, language learning and computing skills. Long-term goals.
Communication / Life SkillsGood listener, fairly confident and sociable. Honest person. I'll tell you directly if I lack the knowledge of a topic rather than hiding it. Not afraid of criticism / negative feedback.
PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENTS
