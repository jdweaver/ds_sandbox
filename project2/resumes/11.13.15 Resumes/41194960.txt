PERSONAL STATEMENT
I am a keen, enthusiastic and motivated individual with a passion for the welfare and ethical treatment of animals. I have a Level 3 Extended Diploma in Animal Management and a wealth of transferable skills that I believe would equip me within the animal care industry. As well as my profound love for animals, I have excellent communication skills and can work effectively alone or part of a team.
