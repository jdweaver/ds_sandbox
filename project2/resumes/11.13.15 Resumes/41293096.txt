ACADEMIC PROJECTS:

Title: RF controlled Robotic Boat to travel in water for ocean research applications.

Technology:   
  
 Domain		:   Robotics, Wireless Communication.
 Microcontroller	:   AT89S52.

Description:                     
      This project is a prototype boat that can travel in water. This robot is powered by 9V rechargeable battery. The direction of the robot can be controlled by an RF remote. This can be moved forward and reverse direction using geared motors of 60RPM. Also this robot can take sharp turnings towards left and right directions. This project uses AT89S52 MCU as its controller. 
          The RF modules used here are STT-433 MHz Transmitter, STR-433 MHz Receiver, HT12E RF Encoder and HT12D RF Decoder. The encoder continuously reads the status of the switches, passes the data to the RF transmitter and the transmitter transmits the data.
