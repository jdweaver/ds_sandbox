CAREER HISTORY
Financial Conduct Authority						Aug 2014 - Present
IT Small Change Delivery Manager
Working in the IS department I am responsible for delivering a portfolio of small, discrete and independent projects, with costs ranging from 5k - 250k. Strong project management skills are required as these projects often have tight budgets and there are no ring-fenced staff to deliver, meaning matrix management is a certainty. Often these projects are considered low priority, whilst at the same time are operationally critical and so prioritisation is key to a successful delivery.
The key skills I currently exhibit are:
* Project delivery
* Business Analysis
* Budget control 
* Risk management and mitigation 
* MI Reporting
* Presentation 
* Negotiating and influencing
* Attention to detail

BSKYB							         		Apr 2011 - Jul 2014
Project Manager/ Service Manager (3 direct reports)		
Reason for leaving - role made redundant
During my tenure at BSKYB I have developed a multitude of skills related to service and project management. My role has required knowledge of a highly technical nature as well as operational input, and a large proportion of work is of a time- sensitive nature. Much of the role has been managing multiple complex projects concurrently to budget and within required timescales. Projects have differed in complexity and subject matter, and have been both independent and part of a programme of work. Project budgets ranged from £250k to £3m.The role has required a great deal of communication and relationship building with a number of different functions within BSKYB as well as with external clients, both national and multinational. Governance of projects and BAU alike is an essential part of the role. Proven key skills were:
* Technical Project delivery
* Budget control 
* Estimating and forecasting 
* Resource planning
* Risk management and mitigation 
* Reporting
* Highly skilled in translating technical and detailed process into business presentation 
* Negotiating and influencing
* Attention to detail
* Governance and quality assurance
