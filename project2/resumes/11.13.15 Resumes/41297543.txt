I am an experienced administrator and customer service provider, with excellent literacy skills and an ability to present ideas through both verbal and written communication. In my current role I am responsible for designing, researching and writing content for two websites and editing the content of an additional website so I am confident in my ability to express new concepts intended for a public audience. Furthermore, I am responsible for interacting with customers both directly, through online chat forums, via telephone conversations, social media, and instant chat messenger conversations, and indirectly, through forum marketing and social bookmarking sites. Through this, I am accustomed to adapting my interaction style to the role I am presenting in order to obtain the best possible results for both the customer and the company as a result of a positive and therefore successful interaction. Above all, I am a very motivated and responsible worker, with the ability to use my own initiative and be flexible with respect to the responsibilities required of me and all other aspects of my role.
