	As a recent graduate of Boston University, I have the pleasure of being able to offer a wealth of recent academic and professional experience with a youthful perspective on business management. With upwards of three years of experience as a full charge bookkeeper, I insist upon accuracy and efficiency in records management, interpretation, inventory tracking and vendor communications, and have simultaneously been responsible for providing contractor support, offering assistance in their business, including with commissions tracking, advertising, and client generation. The ultimate support staffer and manager, I am currently looking to expand my freelancing portfolio to new businesses. In my personal life, I am an avid hiker, dog lover, yogini and rock climber.
