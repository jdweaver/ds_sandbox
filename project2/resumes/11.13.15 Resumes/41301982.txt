Profile: I am a very passionate, determined, hardworking and reliable person.l I am able to pick up new skills and learn new things quickly. I am able to work well within teams but also individually. I'm very adaptable to different work environments and flexible to different roles. 

Work Experience: 
Provident Personal Credit as office clerk, But job role was only temporary, filing, data processing 

Volunteered at the Essex University in the Resource Centre Sociology Department, my duties include filing inputting data and other administrative duties. Please see below my reference of Rowena Macaulay. 

GFM 01/2012 - Present: did temp work with this company, did both Data processing and Mailroom worker where I learnt to work quicly but also accurately, also improved typing speed and inputting data accurately. Work was scattered between 2012 due to company only contacting when there was availability. 

Cambian Healthcare 10/2011-12/2011: worked as a support worker in St. Paul's Hospital in the high risk men's ward where I had to assist them and observe them on a daily basis. The reason this was short lived is because both myself and my supervisor came to the mutual decision the job wasn't for me and that me being a young woman restricted me quite a lot with the service users.
