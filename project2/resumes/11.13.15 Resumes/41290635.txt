Personal Statement
I have recently completed my degree at **** University and am looking for either full or part time work in my hometown. I am a personable, enthusiastic and hard working individual. I have two and a half years restaurant experience in both junior and management roles, supervising a small team of waiting staff since January 2010. Due to the intensity of restaurant management - competing priorities; time management; necessity of effective delegation; a constant awareness of all activity in a fast paced atmosphere - I believe the skills I have acquired could easily extend beyond hospitality. I am extremely able with regards to organisation and time management, as reflected by my ability to work throughout my studies whilst maintaining high grades. As well as my listed work experience, I have also completed a work placement at *****, where I worked amongst the office staff - gaining general administration skills - and the wider community. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of working within an unfamiliar religious community and a historical site, using it as the basis for an extensive research project, contributing to my degree course.
