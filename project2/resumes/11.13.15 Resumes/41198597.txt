Key  Skills

From my time in education I have learnt many of the ins and outs of Microsoft office including database building and basic programming.

Whilst working as a computer tech a lot of my jobs have required the problem to be solved within a specific time frame. From this I have become adept at managing my time.
* Communication Skills
Working abroad presented many challenges, especially the language barrier. I feel like I can communicate with anyone after my experiences.
* Teamwork
I have extensively been involved with teamwork in both academic and working environments. Whilst I was in Uganda it was essential to interact with colleagues in order to complete a task.
