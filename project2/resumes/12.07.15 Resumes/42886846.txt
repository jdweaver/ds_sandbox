Hobbies: 	I am a walking guide on healthy food. I love to cook food that is both good for your body but also makes you happy. I love cycling - I feel like fish in the sea in the Netherlands. My other hobby is hiking, not so much luck with the country here. This is something I do on holidays outside the Netherlands.
