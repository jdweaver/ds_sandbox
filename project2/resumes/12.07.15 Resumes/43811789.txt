

With over nine years of experience across program management, capacity building and teaching - acquired in roles in Southeast Asia - I would be an excellent addition to the Faculty of Tropical Medicine research services team. I have a proven track record in establishing strong collaborations and partnerships, researching effectively, providing results driven training and editing professional communications. My broad experience gives me a large range of skills and perspectives to bring to the Assistant Research Administrator role at Mahidol University.
