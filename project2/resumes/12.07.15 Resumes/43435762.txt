I work as a senior manager in Financial services. I am not very well payed employee. Although I work a lot of hours I try to be passionate with my job.
•	I manage to plan my work so that it was done on time.					
	
•	I also manage my time well.					
	
•	And kept in mind the results that I had to achieve in my work,					
	
•	By being  able to set priorities.					
	
•	And  to carry out my work efficiently.					
	
•	I take on extra responsibilities.					
	
•	I start new tasks myself, when my old ones were finished.
