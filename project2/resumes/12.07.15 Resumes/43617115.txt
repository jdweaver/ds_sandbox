Achievements/Skills

Within my first two months at Nationwide Building Society I was awarded employee of the month.

I pushed the York branch of Nationwide forward with digital awareness to support the company's digital agenda. To do this I ran the first digital service desk in any branch. To promote myself and my work I created a brand for myself under the name of "Digital Dan". I became well known within the Society and was complimented by many senior managers and other branches. The Society has now rolled out digital service demonstrations across all branches.

I am the "viewpoint co-ordinator" of my branch. This involves attending monthly area meetings and promoting engagement and enablement in my branch to ensure my team are well engaged and successful .
