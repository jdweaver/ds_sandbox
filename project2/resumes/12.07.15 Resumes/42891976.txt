OBJECTIVE
I am looking to gain my first job in the IT sector after investing my own time and money studying towards my first IT qualification.


PROFILE 
Hard working highly motivated graduate looking to start a career within IT. Reliable, punctual and always take pride in my work. Known for having a somewhat photographic memory, which gives me a great ability to retain information and pick up new skills quickly. After many frustrating years of working in a variety of different working environments including retail, catering and the motor trade, I became interested in computers after helping colleagues with their computer issues. I then took it upon myself to learn more about the systems I use on a daily basis at my current employment. This inspired me to begin an online learning course to increase my knowledge and take my first step towards a career in IT.
